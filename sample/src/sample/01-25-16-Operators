Class notes for 02-25-16

This class mainly discussed on Operators.

There are three types of operators

1. Arthemetic operators
ex: +, -, *, /, %, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, ++, --

2. Relational operators

Ex.==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

3. Bollean and Logical Operators

Ex:

Logical AND = &
Logical OR = |

Short-circuit AND = &&
Short circuit OR = |

The difference between logical and Short circuit operators are when you use logical operator even if the first
Statement is not true, the second statement is executed..

Example if ( (age 1 > age 2) & (age 1 > age2++))

in the above statement even if age 1 is not greater than age2, the second statement get executed.
Most of the times it is used to assign something to check some condition and assign the value anyway.

In short-circuit and if the first statement evaluated to False it will not evaluate the second of the statement

Examples:

Arithmetic Operators:

Addition: +
Subtraction: _
Multiplication:*
Division:/
Modulus: %
Increment: ++
Decrement: --

Relational Operators:

Equal to : ==
Not Equal to:!=
greater than: >
Less than: <
Greater than or equal to: >=
Less than or equal to : <=

Bitwise Operators:

it is applied to only integer types of byte, short, int, long and char

Bitwise  AND: &
Bitwise  OR: |
Bitwise XOR: ^
Bitwise complement: ~
LeftShift: <<
Right Shift: >>
Zero Fill Right: >>>

Logical Operators:

AND: &&
NOT: !
OR : ||

Assignment Operators:

Simple Assignment Operator: =
Add AND Assignment: +=
Subtract AND assign: -+
Multiply AND assign: *=
Division AND assign: /=
Modulus AND Assign: %=
Left Shift AND Assign: <<=
Right Shit AND Assign = >>=
Bitwise And AND Assign: &=
Bitwise OR AND assign: |=
Bitwise Exclusive OR AND assignment : ^=

!=
+=
-+
*=
/=
%=
